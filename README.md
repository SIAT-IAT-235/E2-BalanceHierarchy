# **Exercise 2: Exploring Balance and Hierarchy**

**Due Date:** February 3, 2025, 11:59 PM  
**Total Marks:** 100  

---

## **Objective**

In this exercise, you will expand on the concepts introduced in **P1** by focusing on **balance** and **hierarchy**. Using the content of **P1** (details of four AI incidents), you will create sketches that explore different design approaches. The goal is to experiment with layout and visual principles to convey information effectively.

## **Instructions**

### **Requirements for All Sketches**

1. **Base Content:**
   - Use the details from **P1** for one of your selected AI incidents. Ensure the following elements are included in each sketch:
     - **Title:** The title of the incident.
     - **Organization:** The organization(s) involved in the incident.
     - **Date:** The date of the incident.
     - **Summary:** A short description of the incident.
     - **Impact:** Key impacts or consequences of the incident.
     - **Link:** A link to relevant information about the incident.

2. **Sketches:**
   - For each sketch, focus on the specific design constraint provided. Do not worry about colour, interactivity, or final polishâ€”this exercise is meant to explore layouts and hierarchy.

---

### **Sketch Requirements**

You will create **six sketches** exploring different layouts. Each sketch must adhere to the constraints below:

1. **Asymmetrical Layout for Desktop:**
   - Design a layout for desktop screens that uses asymmetry to achieve balance and focus.
   - Consider how placement of content can draw attention to key details without centering everything.

2. **Symmetrical Layout for Mobile (Without Centering Everything):**
   - Create a layout for mobile screens that maintains symmetry but avoids centering all elements.
   - Use visual alignment to establish balance and structure.

3. **Asymmetrical Layout Using Empty Space for Desktop:**
   - Focus on using empty or white space strategically in a desktop layout to guide the viewer's attention to important content.

4. **Mobile Layout Using Space for Hierarchy:**
   - Use space alone (e.g., padding, margins) to define the hierarchy and importance of elements on a mobile screen.

5. **Desktop Layout Using Alignment for Hierarchy:**
   - Create a layout for desktop screens that relies solely on the alignment of elements (e.g., left, right, or justified) to establish visual hierarchy.

6. **Mobile Layout Using Scale for Hierarchy:**
   - Design a mobile layout where only the scale (size) of text or elements creates a clear visual hierarchy.

### **Submission Instructions**

1. **Sketch Format:**
   - Create your sketches digitally or on paper. If drawing by hand, ensure they are clean, legible, and scanned or photographed clearly.
   - Each sketch must include:
     - A label identifying the design constraint (e.g., "Asymmetrical Layout for Desktop").
     - The incident title and base content from **P1**.

2. **Upload to GitHub Pages:**
   - Add the sketches to a new page on your personal website (e.g., a section for **Exercise 2**).
   - Ensure each sketch is displayed with its label and a brief explanation of your design choices.

3. **Submit on Canvas:**
   - Provide the link to the **Exercise 2** page (hosted on GitHub Pages) on the **Exercise 2 Submission** page on Canvas.

| **Adherence to Design Constraints** | Sketch does not follow the specified design constraints.                                        | Sketch partially follows the design constraints but lacks clarity.                       | Sketch follows the design constraints with some inconsistencies.                           | Sketch adheres to the design constraints with only minor issues.                               | Sketch fully adheres to the design constraints and effectively demonstrates balance and hierarchy. | 40        |
| **Clarity and Execution**         | Sketch is unclear, illegible, or missing key content.                                           | Sketch is somewhat clear but lacks attention to detail.                                  | Sketch is clear and includes all required content but lacks refinement.                    | Sketch is well-executed, clear, and thoughtfully presented.                                     | Sketch is professionally presented, legible, and demonstrates excellent execution.              | 40        |
| **Submission Requirements**       | Sketches are not uploaded or not linked on GitHub Pages.                                        |           | Sketches are uploaded and linked but missing explanations or minor organizational issues.   |  | Sketches are fully organized, correctly linked, and accompanied by thoughtful explanations.      | 20        |

## **Tips**

- **Experiment with Layouts:** Focus on exploring the design constraints creatively. There is no single "correct" solution.
- **Keep It Simple:** Avoid overcomplicating your sketches. Use only the required content and stick to the specified constraints.
- **Explain Your Choices:** Briefly explain how your sketch addresses the design constraint for better clarity and understanding.

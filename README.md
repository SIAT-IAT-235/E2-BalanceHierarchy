# **Exercise 2: Exploring Balance and Hierarchy**

**Due Date:** February 3, 2025, 11:59 PM  
**Total Marks:** 100  

---

## **Objective**

In this exercise, you will build on your work from **P1** by exploring and applying key design principles: **balance**, **hierarchy**, and **Gestalt principles**. 

The exercise is divided into three parts:
1. Create sketches exploring different layout constraints to experiment with balance and hierarchy.  
2. Incorporate Gestalt principles into additional sketches for mobile and desktop layouts.  
3. Update your HTML and CSS from **P1**, applying the design of your Gestalt desktop layout sketch to improve the visual organization and clarity of your AI incidents page.

Through this exercise, you will enhance your understanding of design principles and improve the presentation of information on the web.

## **Part 1: Sketches for Balance and Hierarchy**

### **Requirements for All Sketches**

1. **Base Content:**
   - Use the details from **P1** for one of your selected AI incidents. Ensure the following elements are included in each sketch:
     - **Title:** The title of the incident.
     - **Organization:** The organization(s) involved in the incident.
     - **Date:** The date of the incident.
     - **Summary:** A short description of the incident.
     - **Impact:** Key impacts or consequences of the incident.
     - **Link:** A link to relevant information about the incident.

2. **Sketches:**
   - For each sketch, focus on the specific design constraint provided. Do not worry about colour, interactivity, or final polishâ€”this exercise is meant to explore layouts and hierarchy.

### **Sketch Requirements**

You will create **six sketches** exploring different layouts. Each sketch must adhere to the constraints below:

1. **Asymmetrical Layout for Desktop:**
   - Design a layout for desktop screens that uses asymmetry to achieve balance and focus.
   - Consider how placement of content can draw attention to key details without centring everything.

2. **Symmetrical Layout for Mobile (Without Centering Everything):**
   - Create a layout for mobile screens that maintains symmetry but avoids centring all elements.
   - Use visual alignment to establish balance and structure.

3. **Asymmetrical Layout Using Empty Space for Desktop:**
   - Focus on using empty or white space strategically in a desktop layout to guide the viewer's attention to important content.

4. **Mobile Layout Using Space for Hierarchy:**
   - Use space alone (e.g., padding, margins) to define the hierarchy and importance of elements on a mobile screen.

5. **Desktop Layout Using Alignment for Hierarchy:**
   - Create a layout for desktop screens that relies solely on the alignment of elements (e.g., left, right, or justified) to establish visual hierarchy.

6. **Mobile Layout Using Scale for Hierarchy:**
   - Design a mobile layout where only the scale (size) of text or elements creates a clear visual hierarchy.

## **Part 2: Gestalt Principles and Sketches**

### **Requirements**

1. **Base Content:**
   - Take a look at the data you presented from **P1** (four AI incidents) and use it as the foundation for your new sketches.

2. **Sketches:**
   - Create **two new sketches** using Gestalt principles:
     - **Mobile Layout Using Gestalt Principles:**
       - Design a layout for mobile screens that uses one or more Gestalt principles (e.g., proximity, similarity, continuity, closure, or figure-ground) to organize and group information effectively.
     - **Desktop Layout Using Gestalt Principles:**
       - Design a layout for desktop screens that applies one or more Gestalt principles to enhance the visual hierarchy and user experience.

3. **Gestalt Principles:**
   - Clearly label which Gestalt principle(s) you have used in each sketch and briefly explain how they are applied to organize or emphasize content.

## **Part 3: Update Your HTML and CSS**

1. **Apply Your Desktop Gestalt Sketch:**
   - Using the **desktop layout sketch** from **Part 2** (Gestalt principles), update the HTML and CSS you created in **P1**.
   - Ensure the following:
     - The HTML structure aligns with the hierarchy and grouping from your sketch.
     - The CSS styling reflects the visual emphasis and principles of the sketch.
     - Incorporate the Gestalt principle(s) used in your sketch to improve the presentation of the content.

2. **Validation and Testing:**
   - Validate your updated HTML and CSS using the W3C Validator.
   - Test your updated page to ensure it functions correctly and aligns with the sketch.

3. **Deployment:**
   - Publish the updated project on your GitHub Pages site.
   - Replace the old **P1** page with the newly updated version.

---

### **Submission Instructions**

1. **Sketch Format:**
   - Create your sketches digitally or on paper. If drawing by hand, ensure they are clean, legible, and scanned or photographed clearly.
   - Each sketch must include:
     - A label identifying the design constraint (e.g., "Mobile Layout Using Scale for Hierarchy" or "Desktop Layout Using Gestalt Principles").
     - The incident title and base content from **P1** or Part 2.

2. **Upload to GitHub Pages:**
   - Add the sketches to a new page on your personal website (e.g., a section for **Exercise 2**).
   - Ensure each sketch is displayed with its label and a brief explanation of your design choices and principles used.
   - Replace the **P1** page with your updated HTML and CSS from **Part 3**.

3. **Submit on Canvas:**
   - Provide the link to the **Exercise 2** page (hosted on GitHub Pages) on the **Exercise 2 Submission** page on Canvas.

## **Tips**

- **Experiment with Layouts:** Focus on exploring the design constraints creatively. There is no single "correct" solution.
- **Use Gestalt Principles:** Consider how principles like proximity, similarity, and alignment can improve clarity and emphasize key information.
- **Keep It Simple:** Avoid overcomplicating your sketches. Use only the required content and stick to the specified constraints.
- **Explain Your Choices:** Briefly explain how your sketch addresses the design constraint for better clarity and understanding.
